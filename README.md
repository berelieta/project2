## Airlines Delay

Chosen topic and rationale
We chose an Airlines Delay dataset that contains data from the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), that has information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights that appear in the DOT’s Air Travel Consumer  Report for the year 2008. The information will allow us to explore airline on-time statistics and delay causes. 
We opted for this topic because as a team we found interesting the flight information that is on the dataset and all the different variables that can be combined in different graphic components to display to the end user interesting data from United States domestic flights operated by large carriers, such as demographic charts, delay causes, origin and destination from flights.
